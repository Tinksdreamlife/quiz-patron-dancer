# X-Rated and Educated

This is Tink's first JavaScript project. The title is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the world of adult entertainment. Tink, a professional dancer and content creator, developed this quiz game as an early model to highlight best practice behaviors and ideas for both patrons and dancers.
